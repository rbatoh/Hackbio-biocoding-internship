## Overview
This project presents a solution to a task that required forming a team and organizing specific information about each member using simple data structures in either Python or R. The solution was implemented in Python, using nested dictionaries to organize information about each team member in a clear, logical and structured format.


## Code Explanation
### Data Organization
The data of each team member was organized using a nested dictionary, where:
 1. Each team member is identified by a key (e.g., Member_1, Member_2).
 2. Each member's details (name, Slack_username, email, hobby, country, discipline, prefered programming language) are stored as key-value pairs within their respective dictionaries.

### Code structure
The code is structured as follows:

 1. A main dictionary (Team_tryosine) is defined, with keys (Member_1 to Member_6) representing individual team members.
 2. Each key contains another dictionary with detailed information about the member.
 3. The print() function at the end outputs the structured Team_tryosine dictionary in a readable format, displaying the details for each team member in the terminal.

## Conclusion
This solution demonstrates how simple Python data structures can effectively store and display information  without the need for complex programming constructs.
